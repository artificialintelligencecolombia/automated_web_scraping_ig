SELENIUM

---------------------
Fundamentals
---------------------

The core of selenium is webDriver.

WEBDRIVER: Interface to write sets of instructions that can be run in many browsers.

WAITS
---------------------

Implicit Waits
---------------
Selenium waits for a defined maximum amount of time for ALL elements to be present before throwing a NoSuchElementException.
    - Applied globally across all elements in the script.

Explicit Waits
---------------
Selenium waits for specific conditions (like visibility or clickability) for individual elements, with a defined timeout.
    - Applied to specific elements or conditions in the script.

Implicit vs Explicit
---------------
- Implicit Wait: Simple but less precise, applied globally.
- Explicit Wait: More precise and efficient, but requires more setup and control over conditions.

NOTE: Warning! Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times.
